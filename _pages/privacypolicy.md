Privacy Policy
Effective Date: October 6, 2024

theBartender.ai ("we", "our", "us") is developed by Toan Nguyen. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your personal information is handled in a safe and responsible manner.

1. Information Collection
theBartender.ai does not collect, store, or transmit any personal or financial information. The app operates fully offline, and all game-related data (such as player names, buy-ins, and chip values) is stored locally on the user's device.

2. No Data Sharing
Since the app does not collect any personal or gameplay data, there is no data shared with third parties. All data remains within the app and on the user's device.

3. Third-Party Services
theBartender.ai does not use any third-party analytics, advertising services, or cloud storage systems. No data is sent to any external servers.

4. User Responsibility
As a user, you are responsible for any information entered into the app. We recommend not entering sensitive information, as it is not required for the app's functionality.

5. Security
Since the app does not store personal data or connect to the internet, there are no additional security measures necessary beyond what is provided by your device's operating system.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.
